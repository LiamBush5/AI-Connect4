# Connect 4 AI

This repository contains a Connect 4 game built using Next.js and TypeScript, featuring multiple AI strategies that users can play against. The goal of this project is to create an interactive and challenging game by incorporating a variety of AI algorithms, showcasing how decision-making can be implemented in a classic game environment.

## Project Goals

- **AI-Driven Gameplay**: Implement a range of AI strategies, from simple random moves to more complex algorithms like Minimax, Negamax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning. These strategies are designed to provide varying levels of difficulty, allowing users to test their skills against different AI opponents.
- **Interactive UI**: A clean, responsive user interface built using Tailwind CSS, ensuring that the game is intuitive and enjoyable to play on any device.
- **Learning Platform**: This project also serves as an exploration of AI decision-making in games, demonstrating practical applications of algorithms in a real-world setting.

## Features
